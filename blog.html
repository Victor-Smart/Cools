            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology">
                Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage, and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate information.[2]
                      <br><br>
                The term <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliance with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.[3]
                <br> <br>
                ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving.[4] It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers, digital television, email, or robots). Theoretical differences between interpersonal-communication technologies and mass-communication technologies have been identified by the philosopher Piyush Mathur.[5] Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals for the 21st century.[6]

                A group of <abbr title="Fifty">50</abbr> people attended a seminar. Suddenly the speaker stopped and started giving each person a Balloon. Each one was asked to write his/her name on it using a marker. 
                Then all the Balloons were collected and put in another room. Now these Delegates were let into that room and asked to find the balloon which had their respective names written on within 5 minutes. Everyone was frantically searching for their names, pushing and colliding with each other, and there was utter Chaos. At the end of 5 minutes, No One could find their own Balloons. 
                Now each one was asked to Randomly Collect a Balloon and Give It to the Person whose Name was written on it. Within minutes, Everyone had their own Balloons. The Speaker began: 
                <q>This is exactly what is happening, in our lives. Everyone is frantically looking for happiness, all over the place, not knowing where it is. Our Happiness Lies in the Happiness of Other People. Help them Find their Happiness and You will Get your Own Happiness too. And this is the Purpose of Human Life... Learn to Put a Smile on Someone's Face, and You will also Smile in due course.</q> <br>
                
                Food for thought <br>
                L E S S O N : when you're making others to succeed in life, you also become a huge Success.
